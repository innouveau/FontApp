	    <h1>Why</h1>
	    Normally when you are searching for a font for your design you are confronted with an endless list of fonts, alphabetically ordered.
	    In FontApp you will find a font by specifying its appearance; you can say whether you want a Serif, Sans Serif, etc. But you can also say if you want it to be
	    slightly lighter or wider. <br><br>
	    In the Specimen mode you can see a font isolated; in the Poster mode you can see combination of fonts.<br><br>
	    We added some basic designing tools (aligning, line height, etc), but we don't have the intention to be a designing tool. The basic is to help you find
	    your font, the tools are to assist you.
